Main Project Name : Movies.Mvc

Backend Stack : Asp.Net MVC and REST API with json as the data format.
Front end Stack: Bootstrap, Angular JS and Jquery.

Angular JS is used due to the following advantages:
1) Separation of processing logic from HTML. In this application the Angular controller is in the app.js (Scripts folder) file.
2) Use of ng-repeat, ng-init and ng-click directives allows smaller html file.

Jquery is used together with Angular as Jquery has the ability to select multiple elements sharing the same css class or other attributes.
